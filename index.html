                    <p>Psychotherapy originated from the earlier term, <em>psychotherapeia</em>, combining the meanings of <em>psyche</em> (soul/mind) and <em>therapeia</em> (attending to, caring for). It was used to characterise the <em>“prevention and remedy of disease by psychical influence”</em> (Dendy, 1853) and give prominence to the helpful influence of witnessing, discussing and being with the reality of the other.</p>

                    <p>Since 2006 I have worked in mental health settings both with individuals and with groups, and facilitated Buddhist meditation workshops. My places of work have included the Terrance-Higgins Trust, REST project at Mind in Camden, London Metropolitan University, the Centre for Better Health, the JBCS bereavement service, and Enosh, the Israeli mental health association.</p>
		<p>I currently see clients for individual psychotherapy at my home practice in Lower-Clapton and at my office practice in Dalston. I also work part-time providing therapy to children and adolescence at King Alfred School in Hampstead.  </p>

                    <p>After initially studying Psychology and Sociology in Israel, I was inspired to search for a wider understanding of life and the human mind.  My early counselling training was ‘integrative’, meaning that I engaged with many of the core traditions of psychotherapy. Following on from this, I trained as an existential psychotherapist and a group facilitator.</p>
                    <p>Since 2006 I have worked in mental health settings both with individuals and with groups, and facilitated Buddhist meditation sessions. My places of work have included London Metropolitan University, the Centre for Better Health, the JBCS bereavement service, and Enosh, the Israeli mental health association.</p>
                    <p>I currently see clients for individual therapy at my private practice, at the Terrance Higgins Trust and at King Alfred School. I also work as a facilitator for a support group at Mind in Camden for the REST project, which supports people who experience dependency of minor tranquillisers.</p>

                    <!--<p>I am a qualified counsellor and psychotherapist and a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, currently extending my training in the field of existential-phenomenological psychotherapy. </p>
					<p>I have been working in mental health centres since 2006, supporting young and adult individuals, facilitating therapeutic groups and Buddhist meditation. I am currently working as a counsellor and a mental-health facilitator at London Metropolitan University, the Centre for Better Health, The Jewish Bereavement Counselling Service and Jami mental-health services.</p>
                    <p>I am interested in a variety of theoretical traditions in psychotherapy and found existential philosophy particularly insightful for the practice of psychotherapy. I keep a sceptical distance from all theoretical/philosophical traditions, and attempt to avoid treating my latest beliefs as reality. </p>
                    <p><span class="quote">“The field of psychotherapy is full of beliefs about the nature and causes of a neuroses, whereas neuroses are due to people holding false beliefs positing as real what is not a fact. Theories of neuroses only reproduce on a meta-level the very disease they seek to cure ”</span><br />
